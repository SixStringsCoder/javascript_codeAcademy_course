This project by Steve Hanlon Nov. 6, 2017, is a Code Academy React course app building project.
The goal is to build a React web application, called **Jammming**, which uses the Spotify API to build a website allowing users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.  

The current deployed site can be found at http://g7flat9.surge.sh.
