This project by Steve Hanlon Nov. 6, 2017, is a Code Academy React course app building project.
The goal is to build a React web application, called Jammming, which uses the Spotify API to build a website allowing users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.  The current deployed site can be found at http://g7flat9.surge.sh.

You can also find the project's source files at my Github site: [here](https://github.com/SixStringsCoder/javascript_codeAcademy_course/tree/master/React_projects/jamming).
